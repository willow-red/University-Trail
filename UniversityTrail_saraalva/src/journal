Today I started making my different classes. I added some notes to my planning sheet, which will help me update my UML diagram later.

Today I finalized my classes. I started making my shop enum, and making an enum method that prints it nicely. My current approach
to this project is going through my mock run and implementing different things as they come up. I find it hard to think about the program
as a whole and would rather build it up from my guide.
Next, I would like to work on the shop system more, and the class schedule.

Today I worked more on my classes, specifically the student class. I added a way to load a specific supply list depending on the subclass,
as well as a class schedule.

My first session today included me adding a way to print the supplies list, and I started making the class schedule classes.
My goal is to complete the setup process and then begin working on the events system.

Today I worked a lot on the grades system, specifically the studying menu option. For this option, a player chooses
which class they will study for. It checks how much studying the class requires and changes the player's status accordingly.
This part was very tricky, since each class has a different studying time. I also worked on different methods that would
calculate the total GPA and letter grades that change depending on if the player studied.

Today I added the menu loop. It updates the current player's stats depending on what event they choose to do. I added some menu
options that are custom to the player's major.

Today I added a save file method. This method writes attributes of the player into a text file and allows them to be
reloaded if they would like to continue playing later. It generates a text file that is stored in a saves file in the Eclipse project.
I also hardcoded all of the other majors, because previously I only was using ArtStudent as a test.
I think I am finished with the project! I have a few things that I was not able to implement. The main thing would be the Exam class.
Also for the shop, I wasn't able to figure out how to determine if someone actually bought their supply list or not, so for now
it remains purely for looks.
