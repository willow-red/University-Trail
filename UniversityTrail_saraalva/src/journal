Journal entries of all work sessions

    Throughout working on your project you will add journal entries detailing programming sessions of more than 30 minutes to the working document. 
    Each journal log will summarize what you accomplished during programming sessions. 

	An Overview of what you completed and the design decisions you made, any aspects that still are not functional or were not completed fully, and a representative 
	sample run of your program

    A representative sample run of the program (showing the user interactions and output of your system) - 
    this may or may not be similar to the mock run you create in HW 12.

Today I started making my different classes. I added some notes to my planning sheet, which will help me update my UML diagram later.

May 1,2022
Today I finalized my classes. I started making my shop enum, and making an enum method that prints it nicely. My current approach
to this project is going through my mock run and implementing different things as they come up. I find it hard to think about the program
as a whole and would rather build it up from my guide.
Next, I would like to work on the shop system more, and the class schedule.
This is my output so far:
